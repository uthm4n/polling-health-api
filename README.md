# polling-health-api
This is a simple Python program that polls the Morpheus health API to retrieve information about the health of your appliance every X (you will be given an option to provide a valid integer as input) seconds. 

Feel free to use it as a template because I know it is not perfect (I am no expert or developer) and only shows you a fraction of what the Morpheus API can do. Ideally, you would be performing some processing on the JSON data returned from the API call but I've kept this as simple as possible.
